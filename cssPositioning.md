**Fixed positioning**

Fixes the position of an element relative to the browser window. Element stays fixed in place even when scrolling. Usually applies on menus.. 

**Absolute positioning**

Takes an element out of document flow, browser acts like if the element has no width and height and other elements moves up. The position of the element is then fixed relative to the top level container or the closest parent with specified position.

**Relative positioning**

Sets the position of an element relative to its original position. The element's original width and height is retained in document flow and other elements behave as it was in original position.

**Static, inherited and z-index positioning**

Static positioning is default behavior of elements. Inherited position tells an element to inherit its positioning from its parent element. Z-index controls the vertical stacking order of elements. Elements must have a set positioning for z-index to work.
